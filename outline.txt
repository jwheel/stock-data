1. start the program

2. get a list of symbols

3. set our initial state variables. 
    1. index, set this to 0
    2. we need a timer that fires off once a day
    3. we need a count of how many times we ran the api today

4. Fire off the daily timer. 
    1. start a timer that executes every 15 seconds. 

5. 15 second timer 
    1. go and get a symbol
    2. when it comes back, write the data to a file
    3. increment symbolIndex. Increment tries counted. 
    4. stop when it reaches 500.


6. iterate over the collection of symbols
    1. if the symbol needs to be updated, get history for symbol
    2. when the history comes back, write the response to a file (mongodb). 

7. we need to deal with the limitations of the api
    1. 5 api requests per minute
    2. 500 api requests per day
    3. to do this, we keep track of the number of calls for that day
        1. make calls every 15 seconds until calls exceeds 500, then quit for the day
        2.
